# Debugging tool for data dumps in embedded systems.

Add a data dump into the program of your embedded system to gather data. Find the memory location of the data in your embedded system. Save it as a hex file and place the file inside the same directory as this script. In hexFileParser.py, edit 'fileName' to equal the name of your hex file. Run the script.
